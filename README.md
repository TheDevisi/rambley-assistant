# Rambley Assistant
## How did this project come up?
#### I played the game Indigo Park, and I like the raccoon from this game very much. I like raccoons a lot. When this game I replayed in the background I listened to speeches about intelligent assistants, and given that I study Python I am new to it by the way, I decided to create my own project. That's about how I came up with the idea.

## A small tour

## What you need?
#### Okay, requiments are:
+ Python 3.10 (Download on (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
+ API Key from Google AI Studio (More instruction below, you can get it here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Installation Process
#### This is step-by-step guide
1. Git clone this repo or download it. ```git clone https://github.com/TheDevisi/rambley-assistant.git```

2. Go to downloaded repo and run `install.sh` (Linux) or `install.bat` (Windows).
3. Once all the requirements are installed, the script will ask you for your API key, so go to Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), get it, copy and paste it into the script.
4. If you are on Linux, open terminal and type: ```source venv/bin/activate```
5. Type `python3 chat.py` in your terminal/command prompt to run app.
6. DONE!
